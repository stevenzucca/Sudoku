Inspired for this project by a LeetCode problem [https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/].
The problem passed a jagged array to the method, but I created my solution for a fixed 9x9 two-dimensional array.
Allows for user input and catches invalid input. Also tells when one cannot be solved. I checked it with [https://www.latimes.com/games/impossible-sudoku], and the program goes as far as it can.
